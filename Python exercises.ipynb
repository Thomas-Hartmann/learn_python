    "\n",
    "#### Assignment\n",
    "**The Collatz Sequence**\n",
    "Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. If number is even, then collatz() should print number // 2 and return this value.\n",
    "If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return 3 * number + 1.\n",
    "Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps\n",
    "calling collatz() on that number until the function returns the value 1.\n",
    "(Amazingly enough, this sequence actually works for any integer—sooner\n",
    "or later, using this sequence, you’ll arrive at 1! Even mathematicians aren’t\n",
    "sure why. Your program is exploring what’s called the Collatz sequence, sometimes called “the simplest impossible math problem.”)\n",
    "Remember to convert the return value from input() to an integer with\n",
    "the int() function; otherwise, it will be a string value.\n",
    "Hint: An integer number is even if number % 2 == 0, and it’s odd if\n",
    "number % 2 == 1.\n",
    "The output of this program could look something like this:\n",
    "Enter number:\n",
    "3\n",
    "10\n",
    "5\n",
    "16\n",
    "8 42 1\n",
    "Input Validation\n",
    "Add try and except statements to the previous project to detect whether the\n",
    "user types in a noninteger string. Normally, the int() function will raise a\n",
    "ValueError error if it is passed a noninteger string, as in int('puppy'). In the\n",
    "except clause, print a message to the user saying they must enter an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists\n",
    "**Questions**\n",
    "1. What is []?\n",
    "2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)\n",
    "- For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].\n",
    "3. What does spam[int('3' * 2) / 11] evaluate to?\n",
    "4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?\n",
    "5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?\n",
    "- For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list\n",
    "[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].\n",
    "6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?\n",
    "7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?\n",
    "8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?\n",
    "9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?\n",
    "10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?\n",
    "11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?\n",
    "12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.\n",
    "13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?\n",
    "14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?\n",
    "15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?\n",
    "16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?\n",
    "17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "**1: Comma Code**\n",
    "Say you have a list value like this:\n",
    "`spam = ['apples', 'bananas', 'tofu', 'cats']`\n",
    "Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with and inserted before the last item. For example, passing the previous spam list to the function would return 'apples, bananas, tofu, and cats'. But your function should be able to work with any list value passed to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2: Character Picture Grid**\n",
    "Say you have a list of lists where each value in the inner lists is a one-character\n",
    "string, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "grid = [['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'],\n",
    "['.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.', '.'],\n",
    "['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n",
    "['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.'],\n",
    "['.', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O'],\n",
    "['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.'],\n",
    "['O', 'O', 'O', 'O', '.', '.'],\n",
    "['.', 'O', 'O', '.', '.', '.'],\n",
    "['.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.']]\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can think of grid[x][y] as being the character at the x- and\n",
    "y-coordinates of a “picture” drawn with text characters. The (0, 0) origin\n",
    "will be in the upper-left corner, the x-coordinates increase going right,\n",
    "and w the y-coordinates increase going down.\n",
    "Copy the previous grid value, and write code that uses it to print the image.\n",
    "..OO.OO..\n",
    ".OOOOOOO.\n",
    ".OOOOOOO.\n",
    "..OOOOO..\n",
    "...OOO...\n",
    "....O....\n",
    "**Hint:** You will need to use a loop in a loop in order to print `grid[0][0]`, then `grid[1][0]`, then `grid[2][0]`, and so on, up to `grid[8][0]`. This will finish the first row, so then print a newline. Then your program should print `grid[0][1]`, then `grid[1][1]`, then `grid[2][1]`, and so on. The last thing your program will print is `grid[8][5]`.\n",
    "Also, remember to pass the end keyword argument to `print()` if you don’t want a newline printed automatically after each print() call.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dictionaries - structuring data\n",
    "**Questions**\n",
    "1. What does the code for an empty dictionary look like?\n",
    "2. What does a dictionary value with a key 'foo' and a value 42 look like?\n",
    "3. What is the main difference between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?\n",
    "5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?\n",
    "6. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values()?\n",
    "7. What is a shortcut for the following code?\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if 'color' not in spam:\n",
    "  spam['color'] = 'black'\n",
    "```\n",
    "8. What module and function can be used to “pretty print” dictionary values?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**\n",
    "For practice, write programs to do the following tasks.\n",
    "### Fantasy Game Inventory\n",
    "You are creating a fantasy video game. The data structure to model the player’s inventory will be a dictionary where the keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing how many of that item the player has. For example, the dictionary value:\n",
    "`{'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12}` means the player has 1 rope, 6 torches, 42 gold coins, and so on.\n",
    "Write a function named `displayInventory()` that would take any possible inventory” and display it like the following:\n",
    "Inventory:\n",
    "12 arrow\n",
    "42 gold coin\n",
    "1 rope\n",
    "6 torch\n",
    "1 dagger\n",
    "Total number of items: 62\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You can use a for loop to loop through all the keys in a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### inventory.py\n",
    "```python\n",
    "stuff = {'rope': 1, 'torch': 6, 'gold coin': 42, 'dagger': 1, 'arrow': 12}\n",
    "def displayInventory(inventory):\n",
    "  print(\"Inventory:\")\n",
    "  item_total = 0\n",
    "  for k, v in inventory.items():\n",
    "    print(str(v) + ' ' + k)\n",
    "    item_total += v\n",
    "  print(\"Total number of items: \" + str(item_total))\n",
    "displayInventory(stuff)\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### List to Dictionary Function for Fantasy Game Inventory\n",
    "Imagine that a vanquished dragon’s loot is represented as a list of strings like this:\n",
    "`dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']`\n",
    "Write a function named `addToInventory(inventory, addedItems)`, where the inventory parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory (like in the previous project) and the addedItems parameter is a list like dragonLoot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `addToInventory()` function should return a dictionary that represents the pdated inventory. Note that the addedItems list can contain multiples of the same item. Your code could look something like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def addToInventory(inventory, addedItems):\n",
    "  # your code goes here\n",
    "  \n",
    "inv = {'gold coin': 42, 'rope': 1}\n",
    "dragonLoot = ['gold coin', 'dagger', 'gold coin', 'gold coin', 'ruby']\n",
    "inv = addToInventory(inv, dragonLoot)\n",
    "displayInventory(inv)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The previous program (with your displayInventory() function from the\n",
    "previous project) would output the following:\n",
    "Inventory:\n",
    "45 gold coin\n",
    "1 rope\n",
    "1 ruby\n",
    "1 dagger\n",
    "Total number of items: 48\n",
